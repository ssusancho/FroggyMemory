# Froggy Memory

## Description
Froggy Memory is an interactive game where the player will try their best to follow a computer generated pattern.

## Overview
Froggy Memory is a memory game that makes the player copy a pattern based on a random computer-generated pattern. First, the computer indicates one of the four options, and then the player will choose the option that the computer displayed. The pattern will build up with each turn, and a score tracker will keep a count of the number of turns until the player messes up. After this, the game will end and there will be a tracker that shows the playerâ€™s high score.
